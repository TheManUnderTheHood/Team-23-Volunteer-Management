#Problem Statement

NGOs and event organizers often face difficulties in managing large numbers of volunteers using manual tools like spreadsheets and messaging apps. These methods lead to confusion in task allocation, poor communication, and lack of proper tracking of volunteer participation. There is no streamlined way to match volunteers based on skills or availability, nor an efficient method to record attendance and contribution hours.

To overcome this, a Volunteer Management & Task Allocation System is required to digitize volunteer registration, skill mapping, task posting, and shift allocation. The system should allow volunteers to choose tasks based on interest, enable organizers to monitor participation in real-time, and maintain records for future certification and recognition.
